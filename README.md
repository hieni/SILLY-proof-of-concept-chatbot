# 🤖 SILLY.py - Simple Chatbot for Customer Support (Proof of Concept)

SILLY (**Straightforward Interactive Language Yapper**) is a proof-of-concept chatbot designed to assist customers with common support inquiries. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, it recognizes keywords, matches predefined responses, and generates support tickets. SILLY can handle issues like updates, returns, and agent escalation requests. Although it’s a basic implementation, it provides a functional customer support experience with logs for record-keeping.

This project demonstrates basic chatbot functionality, focusing on keyword matching and automated responses.
